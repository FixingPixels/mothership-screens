log-entry-edam-1,Log Entry :: Greta Base,Station AI: [GRETA-SYS] // Research Log,:: STATUS: ACTIVE STUDY ::,SPECIES RESEARCH // CARCINID,Acoustic Signature of Replication: Preliminary Assessment,2279.08.14 // 23:41:12,Dr. Edam,"<p>We have successfully obtained and contained a care larva for intensive study. We continue to classify the species as carcinid. My initial observations focus heavily on the auditory environment generated during replication cycles. We are consistently registering an extremely high-frequency acoustic emission—a piercing ""<span class=""font-bold text-primary-yellow"">Shriek</span>"". It is far more complex than simple territorial signaling. This phenomenon must be investigated further; I believe it holds the key to the creature's lifecycle and its means of proliferation.</p>"

We now understand that the <span class=""font-bold text-primary-yellow"">Shriek</span> is utilized to transmit a memetic virus which facilitates the assimilation of other lifeforms. It is a biological weapon, designed to propagate the care genetics and achieve mass replication.</p><p>I must document, though I do so grudgingly, that the synthetic science officer, <span class=""text-primary-yellow"">Hinton</span>, performed much of the necessary legwork involved in analyzing the granular frequency shifts associated with this phenomenon.</p>"

I have formalized the internal designation for the sound: the ""<span class=""font-bold text-primary-yellow"">krebslieder</span>,"" or simply, the ""<span class=""font-bold text-primary-yellow"">crabsong</span>"". It perfectly captures the sublime horror of the process.</p><p>This shrill <span class=""text-primary-yellow"">Shriek</span> is what the carcinids use in order to replicate. It is through this <span class=""text-primary-yellow"">Shriek</span> that the cares have already assimilated other lifeforms on Samsa VI.</p>"
